# Technical Test

This test is to gather some information on your familiarity with tools and technologies we use and to get some contextual information on how you approach a development problem. Please limit your time spent on this test to a max of ~4 hrs. Since this is a fairly open test many people can spend a lot of time on this. Feature completion is not the goal; we are looking to see your compentency and familiarity with our tech-stack. At the end, we would like a deliverable of your prototype shared with us (repository or zip folder).
